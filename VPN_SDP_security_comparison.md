Security Comparison in VPN vs SDP
---

# 1. Security issues with traditional VPNs
Enterprises have become more exposed to data breaches. 
Employees working remotely, as well as migration into the cloud, are factors that complicate effective protection of the network perimeter. 
Traditional VPN services are too lenient, allowing staff to access much more network areas than they need for their day-to-day work. 
As a result, these resources assume unwarranted visibility and become more susceptible to compromise.

# 2. Zero-trust remote access and network isolation
From a security perspective, SDP solutions have a number of advantages over VPN. 
First of all, there are no zones of trust in this scenario. An IT administrator needs to clearly define and grant user privileges to access specific applications. 
The users' devices are assigned "point to point" connections. 
The rest of the network's resources are isolated and remain completely inaccessible. 
Some SDP solutions allow for continuous authentication as well as the verification of users and/or devices at the packets level, using an ID-based network technology. 
Security isn't left to chance. 
The entire network traffic is logged for subsequent audit and analysis.

# 3. The inconveniences of using a VPN
Every employee who has used an enterprise VPN before knows that these services operate slowly and unreliably. 
If you are using geographically scattered applications, you will be frustrated about having to connect or disconnect all the time and keep track of the location you are connecting to when accessing an application you need.

# 4. SDP: connecting once is enough to access everything you need
With the right SDP solution in place, the connected end users can access the necessary applications regardless of their location. 
Browser-based solutions that don't use software agents facilitate access for employees who use personal devices, as well as contractors, partners and customers.

# 5. Admins' headache
In the case of migration to the cloud, VPN management becomes complicated. 
IT administrators have to configure and coordinate VPN and firewall policies in different geographic locations. 
This, in its turn, makes it harder to prevent unauthorized access.

# 6. Configuration discrepancies
VPNs need to be configured separately at each data center and cloud. 
With SDP, administrators can add a network resource to the platform once and then manage all policies in the cloud in a centralized way. 
One more benefit of using fully cloud-based SDP solutions is that very few things are subject to extra configuration and maintenance when granting access within a data center or virtual private cloud. All activities, including the ones related to security, are performed in the cloud.

# 7. Expensive scaling
As organizations add new users and increase the number of cloud services they leverage, they spend much more on VPNs and firewalls. 
The reason comes down to the necessity of purchasing additional licenses and more powerful devices. 
Scalability costs a fortune.

# 8. The potential of unrestrained growth
If an organization is using a cloud-based SDP solution, expansion is hardly ever a problem. 
No matter how many users are being connected and how many applications they need, such a service allows for gradual scaling in the cloud without requiring costly equipment.

# 9. Flexible but not free of charge
VPNs provide flexibility as they can connect multiple geographically distributed endpoints, data centers and virtual private clouds. 
However, it takes significant resources and growing expenses to establish and maintain these connections.

# 10. Connect everything in a hassle-free way
SDP solutions allow companies to provide employees with access to specific enterprise IT resources without raising the bar in terms of control requirements and expenses.

In summary, the deep understanding of secure remote access mechanisms incentivizes organizations that are migrating into the cloud to deploy SDP solutions. 
Such services implement a custom network access policy for users and resources on an individual basis. 
These resources stay invisible to unauthorized users, which reduces the potential attack surface. 
Customer orientation of SDP solutions makes them easier to control, applicable across the board, properly protected, and flexible. 
These characteristics beat the benefits of traditional VPN services.

# 11. Software Define Perimeter Benefits
SDP is an approach to cybersecurity based on the Zero Trust Model. 
SDP works to provide the same user experience to those on-premise or beyond a network’s perimeter while granting access to only the resources users need. 
This ability to provide the same experience means that users don’t need to remember to connect the way they would with a current generation VPN. 
For a more in depth look at how SDP improves security, see toolbox’s article Achieve a Zero Trust Network with a Software Defined Perimeter.

Next generation VPN benefits of SDP include the following:
- Provides a Zero Trust/least privilege model—authorize then connect
- Mutual TLS using a provided PKI
- No ports open for public snooping/hacking
- Microsegmentation—a tunnel of one
- Policy-based configuration ensures users can only access specific resources
- Integrates with your existing Identity Access Mechanism (SAML/AD/LDAP)
- No additional hardware or network integration required
- Consistent user experience on premise or off
- Lightweight client requires no end user configuration
- Control access whether applications are on premise or in the cloud
- Provides additional security without additional throughput degradation
- Additional security without significantly more experience

# 12. Current Generation VPN–Advantages and Disadvantages of VPN
Current generation VPNs have worked for years to make accessing resources remotely easier and more secure. 
Thanks to them, people can access resources from beyond their current network. 
VPNs work to send all your network traffic to a separate network. 
This allows you to access resources that are not locally available. 
They also provide features like improved security through encryption, limited profiled based access, and visibility and monitoring. 
At the same time, the focus of the current generation of VPN remains upon protecting resources behind, what has proven to be, an ineffective network perimeter. 
For this reason, it’s time for a more cloud-friendly alternative that accounts for the need for internal security within both a network and the cloud instead of relying on a firewall to protect a network perimeter as this can lead to vulnerabilities.

# 13. SDP Vs VPN—SDP Offers More
As the list above details, SDP provides not only all the features of a current generation VPN but also solutions to many disadvantages of VPN like more security, including application-based security. 
It is worth expanding on a few of the advantages of SDP.

Given the nature of current generation VPNs, they are open to attack through the public internet. 
As mentioned previously, SDP helps eliminate this problem using its technique of leaving ports blocked and encrypting all traffic.

While current generation VPNs can achieve similar results through user-based access policy, the results are often less flexible and tedious to put into place and maintain. 
With SDP, on the other hand, native integration with SAML, LDAP, or Active Directory can permit you to make changes to group membership and immediately impact the access policies for users in your existing Identity Access Management solution.

Another key use case of SDP is as application security. Current VPNs do not directly address application security. 
Once you are on remotely, you have broad access to resources within the perimeter. 
This means that if a user’s VPN password is phished, the attacker has that same broad access. 
SDP helps protect applications and data against such attacks by preventing lateral access to resources—a user only has access to a very narrow set of resources, and with SDPs ability to authenticate access with MFA before permitting the connection to resources, there are multiple levels of protection. 
The result is enhanced application and data access security for internal wired and wireless-based network perimeter devices. 
As an added bonus, this use case addresses regulatory compliance for a wide variety of industries all while improving the end user’s experience through an easy, consistent approach to accessing protected applications and data.
