- Hackers can’t attack what they can’t see
- Make your critical infrastructure & applications invisible
- Move or wrap them within your own SDP
- No visible DNS information nor IP addresses
- SDP connectivity based on need-to-know access model
- Control plane is separate from the data plane
- Device posture & identity verified before access granted
- SDP cryptographically signs clients into the perimeter
- Cloud Security Alliance created SDP for its members
- Withstood 10-billion attempts at 4 annual “hack-a-thons”
- DHS contracted Waverley Labs to make open source SDP
- Follows NIST cyber security guidelines
- Ideal for BYOD, clouds, IoT & cyber physical systems
